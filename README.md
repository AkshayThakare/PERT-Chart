CS 5V81.001: Implementation of data structures and algorithms

Project 4

Akshay Thakare (ast140230)

Description: To find the critical paths in projects (longest path in DAG)

Input specification:
First line of input may have a comment (if line starts with a #). First line of the actual input has N, the number of tasks, and C,the number of precedence constraints. The
next N integers are thedurations of the tasks. 
There may be arbitrary line breaks. Then the next C lines that follows has 2 integers, gives a precedence constraint between 2 tasks.
Tasks are numbered 1..N. Do not assume any ordering of the tasks or theedges. 
Do not process any lines in the input file beyond this.

Limits: There are at most 1000 tasks and 6000 precedence constraints.

Terms Used:
1. Predecessors: Tasks that must be completed before any subsequent, dependent task can begin.

2. EC: Earliest completion time of the task. The earliest point in the schedule at which a task can finish.

3. LC: Latest completion time of the task. The latest point in the schedule at which a task can finish without causing a delay in the overall timeline.

4. Slack: LC â€“ EC, Buffer for the task for its completion without causing delay in the overall timeline of the project.

Classes in the Project:

1. Graph: Class used to create graph, its topological order and calls method from PERT class to calculate the critical paths.

2. PERT: Class used to calculate EC, LC, slack, critical paths and display the tasks information(EC, LC, slack).
